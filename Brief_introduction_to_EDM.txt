Element differential method (EDM) is a strong‚Äêform finite element method, which borrows the idea of FEM in the aspect of using the element mapping technique to obtain spatial derivatives and the idea of collocation method in the aspect of collocating equations at nodes.
The element mapping technique can result in very stable solutions. Collocating at nodes does not require any integration and can result in sparser matrices than FEM. Hence, these two features makes EDM robust and efficient.
Furthermore, the derived spatial derivatives can be directly substituted into the governing equations and equilibrium equations to form the system of algebraic equations. Therefore, EDM is very easy to be coded and implemented in dealing with problems with complicated governing equations and boundary conditions.
